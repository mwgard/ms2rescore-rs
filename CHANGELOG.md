## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-13

First stable 0.5.0 release. No functional changes since 0.5.0-beta.1.

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `annotate_ms2_spectra`: annotate MS2 spectra with theoretical fragment ions
  (tolerance in Da or ppm, configurable fragmentation model and mass mode)
- `score_ms2_spectra`: compute per-ion-series MS2 scoring features (matched
  ions, longest sequence, explained intensity) with optional hyperscore
- `ms2pip_compute_features`: compute 139 MS2PIP XGBoost feature vectors per
  cleavage site from ProForma peptide strings
- `ms2pip_compute_theoretical_mz`: compute theoretical fragment m/z arrays
  (numpy float32) for arbitrary ion types and charges
- `ms2pip_extract_targets`: extract per-ion-type observed intensity arrays
  from annotated spectra for model training
- `AnnotatedMS2Spectrum` and `FragmentAnnotation` types with pickle support
- Codebase restructured into `types/`, `io/`, `scoring/`, and `ms2pip/` modules
- ARM64 wheel builds for Windows and macOS
